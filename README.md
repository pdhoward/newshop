## Sample Commerce site

A front-end reactjs app and backend database server used strictly for prototyping and training

Rather than in-memory db management, mongodb is used (key configurations set through config folder)

## Getting Set Up

Getting the app running on your local machine takes only a few steps:

1. clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/pdhoward/botshop.git
2. update configEx (configuration example) and rename folder to config
3. install its dependencies - `npm install`
4. start the app - npm run start

Configurations can be set for mlab or a local mongo db.
See server.js to modify connections call accordingly

## Backend Server

Note that a backend server is used strictly for prototyping. Not commercial ready
