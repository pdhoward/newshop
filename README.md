## Sample MERN Commerce site

A front-end reactjs app and backend database server used strictly for prototyping and training

Rather than in-memory db management, mongodb is used (key configurations set through config folder)

## Getting Set Up

Getting the app running on your local machine takes only a few steps:

1. clone the project - `git clone https://github.com/pdhoward/newshop.git
2. rename configEX directories (configuration example) to config. One directory is found in the root and the other in client directory. No other updates are needed if the project is run locally
3. install its dependencies - `npm install`
4. start mongodb on your localhost (mongod ...)
5. start the app - npm run start

Configurations can be set for mlab or a local mongo db.
See server.js to modify connections api to mongodb

## Backend Server

Note that a backend server is used strictly for prototyping. Not commercial ready
